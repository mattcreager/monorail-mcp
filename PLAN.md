# Monorail: Project Plan

> Living document. Updated each session. Read this first.

## What Is Monorail?

An MCP tool that lets Claude and humans collaborate on presentation decks in Figma. Not "generate and export" — a live loop where both parties work in the same canvas.

**Named after:** Lyle Lanley's monorail pitch in The Simpsons — an argument so tight it sells the room.

---

## How We Build It: The Ralph Wiggum Approach

We use the **Ralph Wiggum methodology** for development:

- **Persistent Plan** — This document. Updated each session.
- **Clean Sessions** — One task per session with clear completion criteria.
- **Persistent Findings** — Learnings logged to `docs/failures.md`.
- **Iterative Loops** — Keep going until it works.

### The Meta-Connection

| Name | In the show | In our project |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Monorail** | The pitch that lands | The product — decks with narrative coherence |
| **Ralph Wiggum** | "I'm helping!" persistence | The methodology — iterative loops until done |

The product (Monorail) is about **iterative collaboration loops** between Claude and human.  
We build it using **iterative development loops** (Ralph Wiggum approach).  
It's loops all the way down. 🚝

### Cursor Plans vs. Ralph Wiggum Docs

When working in Cursor, you have access to "Cursor plans" — a tool for tracking execution of a single task. Here's how they fit with our persistent docs:

| Artifact | Purpose | Lifespan | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Cursor plan** | Execution tracking for a single task | One session | `~/.cursor/plans/` (ephemeral) |
| **PLAN.md** | Project state, session logs, what's next | Persistent | Workspace root |
| **docs/*.md** | Specs, decisions, reference material | Persistent | `docs/` |
| **failures.md** | Learnings, gotchas, things that didn't work | Persistent | `docs/failures.md` |

**When to use Cursor plans:**
- Task has 4+ implementation steps
- You want todo checkboxes that track progress
- The task is ambitious enough to benefit from structured tracking

**When NOT to use Cursor plans:**
- For design decisions → put in `docs/decisions/`
- For session summaries → put in `PLAN.md`
- For learnings/gotchas → put in `docs/failures.md`

**At session end:** Cursor plan can be discarded. Anything worth keeping goes into the persistent docs.

### What We've Learned 📝

See `docs/failures.md` for details.

**Key findings:**
1. Figma MCP doesn't support Figma Slides (only Design, FigJam, Make)
2. Figma REST API is read-only for design content (can't create frames/text)
3. Write access requires Figma Plugin API (runs in Figma's sandbox)
4. Plugin workflow has friction (manual paste, session per task)
5. **Figma Slides API specifics:**
   - Use `figma.createSlide()` not `figma.createFrame()` for actual slides
   - Set `slide.fills = [{ type: 'SOLID', color }]` for backgrounds (not rectangles!)
   - With `documentAccess: dynamic-page`, use `getNodeByIdAsync()` not `getNodeById()`
   - Slide structure: Page → SLIDE_GRID → SLIDE_ROW → SLIDE (need recursive traversal)

### What's Next 🔨

**v0 COMPLETE!** The full round-trip loop works:
1. Create slides in Figma (or Apply IR from Claude)
2. Edit in Figma — change text, rearrange, refine
3. Export as IR — plugin analyzes and extracts structure
4. Give IR to Claude — "tighten the bullets", "add a timeline slide"
5. Claude returns updated IR
6. Apply to Deck — updates existing, creates new, skips locked
7. Repeat until it lands

**Next steps (v1):**
- [x] **Freeform edit handling** — IMPLEMENTED ✅ (see `docs/decisions/freeform-handling.md`)
  - [x] Name text nodes on creation (`headline`, `bullet-0`, etc.)
  - [x] Update Apply to modify text in-place instead of re-rendering
  - [x] Update Export to capture `extras` (unrecognized text)
  - [x] Add `extras` field to IR schema
- [ ] Improve archetype detection heuristics (edge cases)
- [ ] Handle mixed fonts / complex layouts gracefully
- [ ] Add deck title extraction from first slide
- [ ] Add `chart` and `timeline` archetype detection

**High-priority:**
- [x] **WebSocket bridge** — COMPLETE! ✅ (see `docs/decisions/websocket-bridge.md`)
  - ✅ `monorail_push_ir` and `monorail_pull_ir` tools working
  - ✅ Copy/paste-free workflow achieved
  - ✅ Documented local MCP decision (`docs/decisions/local-mcp.md`)

**Discovery tasks:**
- [ ] **Visual feedback loop** — Claude is currently blind to rendered output!
  - Can't see: text overflow, overlapping elements, broken layouts
  - Options: Plugin exports screenshot, Figma REST API image export, HTML preview
  - Critical for Claude to self-correct visual issues
  - Research: Can Figma plugin export slide as image? Can Claude process it?
- [ ] **Event-driven updates** — decks that stay in sync with reality
  - Webhook triggers: project status, metrics, sprint completion
  - Agent updates specific slides without human intervention
  - Use case: "living deck" that reflects current state
  - Architecture: MCP server as webhook receiver? Scheduled refresh?

## Session Log

### Session 1 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Set up workspace, explore Figma MCP capabilities, establish Ralph Wiggum workflow

**Completed:**
- ✅ Pulled monorail folder from Desktop, reorganized into proper project structure
- ✅ Created MCP server scaffold (`src/index.ts`) with 4 placeholder tools
- ✅ Set up TypeScript, dependencies, builds clean
- ✅ Explored Figma MCP — **discovered it doesn't support Figma Slides**
- ✅ Explored Figma REST API — **confirmed it's read-only for design content**
- ✅ Scaffolded Figma plugin (`figma-plugin/`) — compiles, has basic IR→slides logic
- ✅ Set up Ralph Wiggum approach (PLAN.md, failures.md, clarified naming)

**Key findings logged to `docs/failures.md`:**
1. Figma MCP only supports Design/FigJam/Make, not Slides
2. REST API can't write design content — Plugin API required
3. Plugin workflow has friction (manual paste per iteration)

**Next session task:** 
> Test full loop with Figma plugin manually

---

### Session 2 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Decide integration approach (A/B/C) and implement

**Decision:** Hybrid B+C
- **HTML preview** for instant feedback (fast iteration)
- **Figma plugin** for real output (when ready)
- Best of both: fast iteration AND real Figma slides

**Completed:**
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_validate_ir` — validates IR against archetype constraints
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_create_deck` — creates deck from IR JSON
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_update_slides` — updates non-locked slides
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_get_deck` — retrieves current IR
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_preview` — generates HTML preview file
- ✅ Built HTML preview renderer with all 10 archetypes
- ✅ Tested end-to-end: IR → MCP → HTML preview works!

**Figma plugin debugging:**
- ✅ Fixed `getNodeById` error → use `getNodeByIdAsync` with `dynamic-page`
- ✅ Fixed white backgrounds → use `slide.fills` not rectangles
- ✅ Fixed slide creation → use `figma.createSlide()` for real slides
- ✅ Added all 10 archetypes with proper layout and colors

**The loop works:**
```
Claude generates IR → monorail_create_deck → monorail_preview → preview.html
                                                                    ↓
                                                           Open in browser
                                                                    ↓
                                                        "Copy IR for Figma"
                                                                    ↓
                                                           Figma plugin
                                                                    ↓
                                                            Real slides
```

---

### Session 3 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Complete the v0 loop — make Export IR actually work

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed slide traversal for Figma Slides (SLIDE_GRID → SLIDE_ROW → SLIDE)
- ✅ Implemented `analyzeSlideContent()` — detects archetypes from text layout
- ✅ Export correctly identifies: title, bullets, big-idea, two-column, quote, summary
- ✅ Content extraction works (headlines, sublines, bullets, columns, etc.)
- ✅ Added update-in-place logic to Apply (respects `status: locked`, updates existing slides)
- ✅ **Tested full round-trip: Export → Claude → Apply works!**

**The v0 loop is complete:**
```
Figma Slides                          Claude
     │                                   │
     ├──── Export as IR ────────────────►│
     │     (analyzes slides,             │
     │      detects archetypes)          │
     │                                   │
     │                            Claude refines IR
     │                            (tighten copy,
     │                             add slides, etc.)
     │                                   │
     │◄──────── Apply to Deck ───────────┤
     │     (creates new slides,          │
     │      updates existing,            │
     │      skips locked)                │
     └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Sample export output:**
- Slide 1: `title` → headline: "Monorail", subline: "Where AI helps..."
- Slide 2: `bullets` → headline + 3 bullet items
- Slide 3: `big-idea` → headline + subline
- Slide 4: `two-column` → left/right with titles and bodies
- Slide 5: `quote` → quote + attribution
- Slide 6: `summary` → headline + items

---

### Session 4 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Design freeform edit handling — what happens when humans add content outside archetypes?

**Design decision:** Update in place + Capture extras
- Apply should modify text nodes by name instead of re-rendering (preserves human formatting)
- Export should capture unrecognized text in an `extras` field (Claude sees everything)
- Full details: `docs/decisions/freeform-handling.md`

**Also decided:** How Cursor plans fit with Ralph Wiggum methodology
- Cursor plans = execution tracking for a single session (ephemeral)
- PLAN.md / docs/ = persistent context across sessions
- Added guidance to "How We Build It" section

**Completed:**
- ✅ Design decision for freeform handling (decided, documented)
- ✅ Created `docs/decisions/` folder for architectural decisions
- ✅ Documented Cursor plans vs. Ralph Wiggum docs integration
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with session log and new structure

**Next session task:**
> Implement freeform edit handling — start with naming text nodes, then update-in-place Apply logic

---

### Session 5 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Implement freeform edit handling

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added `nodeName` parameter to `addText()` function
- ✅ Updated all archetypes to name their text nodes (`headline`, `bullet-0`, `left-title`, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented `updateContentInPlace()` — updates `.characters` only, preserves formatting
- ✅ Implemented `detectExistingArchetype()` — identifies archetype from node names
- ✅ Modified Apply logic: same archetype → in-place update; different → re-render
- ✅ Updated Export to track "claimed" nodes and capture unclaimed text as `extras`
- ✅ Added `extras?: string[]` field to Slide interface
- ✅ **Tested full loop manually — it works!**

**Key behavior:**
- First Apply after upgrade: re-renders (old slides have no named nodes)
- Subsequent Applies: updates in-place (nodes now have names)
- Human additions (text outside archetype) captured in `extras`
- Human formatting (position, font, color changes) preserved on in-place update

**What's next:**
- Visual feedback loop (Claude can't see rendered output)
- WebSocket bridge (remove copy/paste friction)
- Edge case improvements (archetype detection, mixed fonts)

---

### Session 6 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Design work — user consumption model, WebSocket bridge priority

**Key insight: Monorail is a collaboration relationship, not just tools**

The product isn't "tools Claude can use" — it's setting up a collaboration where Claude helps with:
1. **Setup** — install plugin, test workflow, confirm everything works
2. **Brief** — find the spine, work through the argument
3. **Build** — generate IR ↔ edit in Figma ↔ iterate
4. **Polish** — lock settled slides, fine-tune the rest

**WebSocket bridge is high priority** because it enables:
1. Copy/paste-free workflow (obvious UX win)
2. **Claude debugging the plugin** — development acceleration
3. The "Claude-assisted everything" model — setup, troubleshooting, iteration

With WebSocket, Claude can: send test IR, get logs, diagnose issues, retry — the plugin development itself becomes a collaboration loop.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Documented collaboration model insight
- ✅ Created `docs/decisions/websocket-bridge.md` with full design
- ✅ Identified research questions (Figma WebSocket support, protocol, security)
- ✅ Proposed MCP tools: `monorail_connection_status`, `monorail_push_ir`, `monorail_pull_ir`, `monorail_get_plugin_logs`
- ✅ Updated Next Session Prompt for WebSocket work

**Next session task:**
> Research and spike WebSocket bridge — can Figma plugin connect to localhost? Build minimal proof-of-concept.

---

### Session 7 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** WebSocket bridge spike — server side + plugin client

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added `ws` package to MCP server
- ✅ WebSocket server runs on `ws://localhost:9876` alongside stdio transport
- ✅ Hello/hello-ack handshake protocol implemented
- ✅ Plugin UI has WebSocket client (auto-connect, status indicator)
- ✅ Added `monorail_connection_status` MCP tool
- ✅ Tested server-side connection works with Node.js client

**Key findings:**
- WebSocket server works alongside MCP stdio — no conflicts
- Protocol is simple JSON messages with `type` field
- Server tracks connected plugin info (name, version, connected time)

**Tested in Figma — IT WORKS! ✅**
- Plugin connects to `ws://localhost:9876` successfully
- Hello-ack handshake works
- UI shows green "Connected to MCP server" indicator
- Reconnection works (tested multiple connect/disconnect cycles)

**Next session task:**
> Implement `monorail_push_ir` and `monorail_pull_ir` tools for copy/paste-free workflow.

---

### Session 8 (2026-01-11)
**Task:** Implement WebSocket push/pull tools

**Completed:**
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_push_ir` — pushes IR directly to plugin, optional auto-apply
- ✅ Implemented `monorail_pull_ir` — requests export, waits for response, returns IR
- ✅ Added WebSocket message handlers for `exported` and `applied` responses
- ✅ Added monorail to Cursor MCP config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
- ✅ Created `docs/decisions/local-mcp.md` — documented why local > remote for this use case
- ✅ **Tested full round-trip: pull → modify → push works!**

**Key findings:**
- Cursor starts MCP server as child process; WebSocket server runs alongside stdio
- If multiple MCP processes start, only one can bind port 9876 — can cause connection issues
- Plugin must reconnect when MCP server restarts
- Local MCP is the right architecture (privacy, latency, simplicity)

**The copy/paste-free loop works:**
```
Claude                              Figma Plugin
   │                                      │
   ├──── monorail_push_ir ───────────────►│ (auto-applies)
   │                                      │
   │◄──── monorail_pull_ir ───────────────┤ (exports & returns IR)
   │                                      │
```

---

## Completion Criteria (v0)

The loop works end-to-end:
- [x] Claude generates IR from a brief
- [x] IR gets rendered visibly (HTML preview ✅, Figma plugin ✅)
- [x] Human can edit in Figma
- [x] Claude can see what changed (Export IR ✅)
- [x] Claude adapts, regenerates
- [x] Repeat until deck lands

**🎉 v0 COMPLETE!** The full round-trip loop is working.

## Next Session Prompt

Copy this to start your next session:

```
I'm working on Monorail — a tool for Claude + human collaboration on presentation decks via Figma.

**Read first:** `PLAN.md` in the workspace root.

---

## The Ralph Wiggum Method

We use this iterative development approach. Please follow it:

1. **Start by reading `PLAN.md`** — understand current state before touching code
2. **One focused task per session** — don't boil the ocean
3. **Log findings to `docs/failures.md`** — gotchas, API quirks, things that didn't work
4. **Update `PLAN.md` at session end** — add a session log entry with:
   - What task you worked on
   - What you completed (checkboxes)
   - What you learned
   - What's next
5. **Update the "Next Session Prompt"** — so the next Claude has fresh context

**Cursor plans:** Use them for ambitious tasks (4+ steps). They're ephemeral — anything worth keeping goes in PLAN.md or docs/. See "Cursor Plans vs. Ralph Wiggum Docs" in PLAN.md.

---

## Current State

**v0 loop is COMPLETE. WebSocket push/pull WORKING! ✅**

The full collaboration loop works — **no copy/paste required:**
1. `monorail_pull_ir` → Claude gets current deck from Figma
2. Claude refines the IR
3. `monorail_push_ir` → sends updated IR directly to plugin (auto-applies)
4. Human edits in Figma (move, restyle, add content)
5. Repeat until deck lands

---

## WebSocket Bridge: FULLY WORKING ✅

**MCP Tools:**
- `monorail_connection_status` — check if plugin connected
- `monorail_push_ir` — send IR to plugin (optional `autoApply`)
- `monorail_pull_ir` — request export, returns IR

**Setup:**
1. Monorail is configured in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
2. Cursor auto-starts MCP server (which starts WebSocket on :9876)
3. Open Figma Slides → run Monorail plugin → auto-connects

**If connection issues:** Check for multiple MCP processes (`ps aux | grep monorail`). Only one can bind port 9876.
