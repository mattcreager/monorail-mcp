# Discovery

> Explorations and spikes BEFORE they become decisions.

## What goes here

- API capability investigations
- "Can we do X?" experiments
- Prototype results
- Research findings

## What doesn't go here

- Final decisions → `docs/decisions/`
- Stable reference docs → `docs/references/`
- Session summaries → `PLAN.md`
- Things that didn't work → `docs/failures.md`

## Lifecycle

1. **Spike:** "Can the plugin read component styles?" → `discovery/component-styles-spike.md`
2. **If promising:** Becomes a decision doc in `decisions/`
3. **If dead end:** Summary goes to `failures.md`, delete spike

## Current Discoveries
