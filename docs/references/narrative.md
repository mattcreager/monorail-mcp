# Narrative Theory for Decks

A deck is not a document with pictures. It's a *performance of an argument*. This reference covers the structural elements that make arguments land.

## The Shape of an Argument

Every effective deck has three movements:

### 1. Setup (Establish the World)

The audience needs to know:
- What situation are we in?
- What's at stake?
- Why should they care?

Setup creates the *container* for your argument. Without it, your solution is an answer to a question nobody asked.

**Good setup**:
- Grounds the audience in shared reality
- Creates stakes (something to lose or gain)
- Builds just enough tension to make them want resolution

**Bad setup**:
- Too long (they're waiting for the point)
- Too abstract (they can't see themselves in it)
- Missing stakes (so what?)

### 2. Turn (The Shift)

Every deck needs a *turn*—a moment where something changes. This is where you move from:
- Problem → Solution
- Analysis → Recommendation  
- What is → What could be
- Conventional wisdom → New insight

The turn is the hinge of your deck. It's the moment the audience's mental model should update.

**Good turns**:
- Clearly marked (you can point to the slide)
- Surprising or reframing
- Earns its place (the setup made us ready for it)

**Bad turns**:
- Buried in a wall of text
- Predictable (they saw it coming 5 slides ago)
- Missing entirely (the deck just... continues)

### 3. Landing (The Resolution)

Where do we end up? The landing includes:
- The ask (what you want them to do)
- The takeaway (what you want them to remember)
- The close (how it ends emotionally)

**Good landings**:
- Concrete ask with clear next step
- Callback to the setup (closes the loop)
- The "hallway sentence" appears literally on a slide

**Bad landings**:
- Vague ("let's continue the conversation")
- New information introduced (no! you're closing!)
- Multiple asks competing for attention

## The Hallway Test

Imagine someone leaves your presentation. A colleague in the hallway asks: "What was that about?"

What do they say?

If the answer is vague ("It was about our strategy" / "They want more budget") → the deck failed.

If the answer is concrete and specific ("They showed we'll hit a support crisis in Q3 unless we automate tier-1 now") → the deck landed.

**Your job**: Make sure that hallway sentence exists, and put it on a slide.

## Stakes

Stakes are what make an audience care. No stakes = no attention.

### Types of Stakes

**Loss stakes**: What do we lose if we don't act?
- Revenue at risk
- Competitive position eroding
- Talent leaving
- Costs escalating

**Gain stakes**: What do we get if we do act?
- New market opened
- Efficiency unlocked
- Risk mitigated
- Advantage secured

**Existential stakes**: What happens to *us* as a team/company?
- "If we don't solve this, we're not who we say we are"
- Use sparingly, but powerful when true

### Making Stakes Concrete

Abstract: "We risk falling behind competitors"
Concrete: "Three competitors launched AI support in 2025. Our CSAT is down 8 points since."

Abstract: "This will improve efficiency"
Concrete: "We'll handle 40% more tickets with the same team"

Stakes need numbers, names, dates. Abstraction kills urgency.

## The Filler Problem

A slide is filler if:
- You could delete it and the argument still works
- It exists because "we should have something about X"
- It repeats what another slide already said
- It's there for political reasons, not argument reasons

Filler is deck cancer. It signals that you're not in control of your argument.

### How Filler Happens

1. **Premature slide-making**: You started building slides before you had a spine. Now you have 20 slides and you're trying to make them "flow."

2. **Stakeholder appeasement**: "We should mention the Q2 initiative." Why? "Because Sarah worked on it." That's not an argument reason.

3. **Insecurity**: "What if they ask about X?" So you add a slide "just in case." If it's not part of the argument, it's an appendix slide, not a main deck slide.

### The Fix

For every slide, ask: "What job does this do for my argument?"

If you can't answer clearly, it's filler. Cut it or find its real job.

## Tension and Release

Arguments work through tension (opening a question) and release (closing it).

**Setup creates tension**: "There's a problem, and we need to solve it"
**Turn promises release**: "Here's how we solve it"
**Landing delivers release**: "Here's specifically what we do"

### Pacing Tension

- Don't release too early (they stop paying attention)
- Don't hold tension too long (they get frustrated)
- Create small cycles within the larger arc (micro-tensions in each section)

### The "So What?" Moment

At any point in your deck, if the audience is thinking "so what?"—you've lost tension.

Every slide should either:
- Raise a question (create tension)
- Answer a question (release tension)
- Move the argument forward

If it does none of these, it's dead weight.

---

## One Idea Per Slide

The most common deck failure: slides doing too many jobs.

A slide that tries to:
- Introduce the problem
- Show the data
- Propose the solution
- Address an objection

...does none of these well.

**Rule**: One slide, one job. If you're combining ideas "to save space," you're actually losing clarity.

---

## The Appendix Trick

Not everything needs to be in the main deck. The appendix exists for:
- Detailed data someone might ask about
- Background context for newcomers
- Methodology explanations
- Backup slides for anticipated questions

This lets your main deck stay tight while still having depth available.

**Appendix rules**:
- Never present appendix slides unless asked
- Label them clearly (slide numbers like A1, A2, or separate section)
- They don't need to "flow"—they're reference material

## Narrative Patterns

Common structures that work:

### Problem → Solution → Proof → Ask
The classic pitch structure. Works when you have a clear problem and a defensible solution.

### Situation → Complication → Resolution
McKinsey-style. Situation (context), Complication (what changed / what's wrong), Resolution (what we do about it).

### What → So What → Now What
Good for presenting analysis. What did we find? Why does it matter? What do we do next?

### Conventional Wisdom → Surprising Truth → Implication
Good for thought leadership or reframing. "Everyone thinks X. Actually Y. Therefore Z."

## Anti-Patterns

### The Book Report
Symptom: Deck reads like documentation. Everything is explained, nothing is argued.
Fix: Find the argument. What are you trying to convince them of?

### The Data Dump
Symptom: Lots of charts, no story. Audience drowns in information.
Fix: One chart per slide. Headline states the takeaway, not the description.

### The Hedge Maze
Symptom: Deck keeps qualifying, caveating, presenting "on the other hand."
Fix: Take a position. You can acknowledge complexity without losing your spine.

### The Slow Reveal
Symptom: The point doesn't arrive until slide 15.
Fix: Give them the headline early. Then prove it. Mystery is for movies, not business decks.

### The Happy Ending
Symptom: Everything is great, no tensions, no stakes.
Fix: Find the tension. If there's no problem, why are we in this meeting?
