# Critic Heuristics

Checklists for evaluating work at each stage. Use these to decide whether to proceed or loop back.

---

## Stage 0 Critic: Spine

The spine is the foundation. If it's weak, everything built on it will be weak.

### Must-Have Checks

- [ ] **Setup exists**: Can you state the situation/problem in 1-2 sentences?
- [ ] **Turn exists**: Is there a clear shift from problem to solution (or analysis to recommendation)?
- [ ] **Landing exists**: Is there a concrete ask or takeaway?
- [ ] **Hallway sentence exists**: Can you say what the deck is about in one specific sentence?
- [ ] **Stakes are clear**: Why should the audience care? What happens if they do nothing?

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| "It's about X" (abstract noun) | No real spine yet | Ask: "What specifically about X? What's the argument?" |
| Setup is 5+ sentences | Too much context, not enough argument | Compress. What's the *essential* context? |
| Turn is vague ("we should do better") | No concrete shift | Ask: "Do better *how*? What specifically changes?" |
| Multiple asks | No clear landing | Pick one. Others go in follow-up or appendix |
| No stakes articulated | No reason to care | Ask: "What happens if we do nothing?" |

### Proceed When

All five must-haves check out, AND you can state the entire argument (setup → turn → landing) in under 60 seconds.

## Stage 1 Critic: Beats

Beats are narrative moves. Each one should do a job.

### Must-Have Checks

- [ ] **Every beat has a job**: Can you name what each beat does for the argument?
- [ ] **No filler beats**: Would the argument break if you removed any beat?
- [ ] **Turn is visible**: Can you point to which beat is the turn?
- [ ] **Sequence makes sense**: Does each beat follow logically from the previous?
- [ ] **Stakes appear early**: Are stakes established before the turn?

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Beat job is "provide context" | Probably filler | Ask: "Context for *what*? Why do they need this before proceeding?" |
| Two beats with same job | Redundancy | Combine or cut one |
| Turn happens in beat 2 of 12 | Front-loaded, no tension | Build more setup, create stakes first |
| Turn happens in beat 11 of 12 | Slow reveal, audience exhausted | Move turn earlier, trim setup |
| Beat is "address objection" before turn | Premature defense | Objections come after you've made the case |

### The Deletion Test

For each beat, ask: "If I deleted this, would the argument still work?"

- If yes → the beat is filler. Cut it or find its real job.
- If no → the beat is structural. Keep it.

### Proceed When

Every beat passes the deletion test, the turn is clearly identifiable, and the sequence feels inevitable (each beat earns the next).

## Stage 2 Critic: IR (Slides)

IR is where content meets constraints. Overflow here means editing, not expanding.

### Must-Have Checks

- [ ] **Every slide has one job**: No slide is doing two things
- [ ] **Archetype fits job**: The chosen archetype is appropriate for the content
- [ ] **Constraints are met**: All word/bullet limits respected
- [ ] **Headlines are insights**: Headlines say something, not just describe
- [ ] **Hallway sentence is on a slide**: The key takeaway appears literally

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Headline is description ("Q3 Revenue") | Missed opportunity | Rewrite as insight ("Q3 revenue exceeded target by 15%") |
| 5+ bullets on a slide | Constraint violation | Split into multiple slides or edit down to 3 |
| Slide has headline + paragraph + bullets | Multiple jobs | Split into multiple slides |
| Chart has no takeaway headline | Data without argument | Add headline that states the insight |
| "Wall of text" anywhere | Presentation, not document | Radical edit: what's the one thing this slide says? |

### Constraint Enforcement

When content exceeds constraints, the content must be edited—not the constraint.

| Constraint | If Violated |
|------------|-------------|
| Headline too long | Find shorter words, cut modifiers, or split the idea |
| Too many bullets | Combine related points, or split to multiple slides |
| Cell content too long | Abbreviate, use icons, or simplify the comparison |
| Quote too long | Edit the quote (with ellipses if needed), or paraphrase |

### Proceed When

Every slide passes constraint check, every headline is an insight (not a description), and the hallway sentence appears literally on a slide.

## Stage 3 Critic: Render

Render is mechanical. If previous stages did their job, this should be straightforward.

### Must-Have Checks

- [ ] **No text overflow**: All text fits within its containers
- [ ] **No clipping**: Nothing cut off at edges
- [ ] **Contrast is readable**: Text is legible against backgrounds
- [ ] **Alignment is consistent**: Elements line up across slides
- [ ] **Typography is consistent**: Same fonts/sizes for same element types

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Text overflows container | Content too long for archetype | Go back to Stage 2, edit content |
| Slides look inconsistent | Template not applied consistently | Check template/style application |
| Chart is unreadable | Wrong chart type or too much data | Simplify data or choose different visualization |
| Weird spacing | Auto-layout not working | Check layout settings, may need manual adjustment |

### Proceed When

All slides render cleanly with no visual defects.

---

## Stage 4 Critic: Review

Final check before delivery. Looking at both visual and narrative quality.

### Visual QA

- [ ] Text readable from 10 feet away (if presenting in room)
- [ ] No orphaned lines (single words on their own line)
- [ ] Images are high resolution (no pixelation)
- [ ] Colors are consistent throughout
- [ ] Animations are purposeful (if any)

### Narrative QA

- [ ] **Loop closure**: Does slide 1 open a question that the final slide answers?
- [ ] **Turn visibility**: Can you point to the exact slide where the deck shifts?
- [ ] **Hallway sentence present**: Is the key takeaway on a slide?
- [ ] **No filler slides**: Could you delete any slide without breaking the argument?
- [ ] **Stakes are felt**: Does the problem feel real and urgent?
- [ ] **Ask is clear**: Does the audience know exactly what you want them to do?

### Red Flags (Narrative)

| Red Flag | Route To |
|----------|----------|
| "I don't know what they want me to do" | Stage 0 (spine - missing clear ask) |
| "This feels long" | Stage 1 (beats - probably filler) |
| "What was slide 7 about?" | Stage 1 or 2 (beat has no clear job) |
| "When did it shift from problem to solution?" | Stage 0 or 1 (turn not clear) |
| "So what?" feeling at any point | Stage 0 (stakes not established) |

### The Fresh Eyes Test

If possible, have someone who wasn't involved look at the deck and answer:
1. What is this deck about? (Should match your hallway sentence)
2. What do they want? (Should match your ask)
3. Which slide is the key insight? (Should match your turn)

If their answers don't match your intent, the deck isn't done.

### Proceed When

Visual QA passes, narrative QA passes, and (ideally) fresh eyes test passes.

| Symptom | Most Likely Stage to Fix |
|---------|-------------------------|
| "I don't know what the point is" | Stage 0 (spine) |
| "It feels unfocused" | Stage 1 (beats) |
| "There's too much on this slide" | Stage 2 (IR) |

| "The ending doesn't land" | Stage 0 (spine - landing) |
| "Slide 7 feels like filler" | Stage 1 (beats) |
| "I can't tell when it shifts" | Stage 0 or 1 (turn) |
| "Who cares?" | Stage 0 (stakes) |
