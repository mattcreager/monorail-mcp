# Monorail: Narrative Toolkit

A deck is an argument with a shape, not a container for information.

This toolkit provides thinking frameworks. Use them fluidly throughout the deck-making process—not as sequential stages, but as lenses to apply when needed.

---

## The Spine

Every deck needs a spine: the core argument in three parts.

**Setup**: The world as it is. The problem. The opportunity. What's at stake.

**Turn**: The shift. Why now. What changes. The insight that reframes.

**Landing**: The ask. The answer. What you want them to do or remember.

### Finding the Spine

Questions to ask:
- What's the situation this deck responds to?
- Who's in the room? What do they already believe?
- What do you want them to *do* after?
- What's the one thing they should remember tomorrow?

### The Hallway Test

> If someone walks out and a colleague asks "what was that about?"—what's the one sentence they say?

That sentence must exist. It must be concrete. "It was about our strategy" = no spine. "We'll hit a support crisis in Q3 unless we automate tier-1 now" = spine.

### Spine Red Flags

| Signal | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Setup takes 5+ sentences | Too much context, not enough argument |
| Turn is vague ("we should improve") | No concrete shift |
| Multiple asks | No clear landing |
| Can't state it in 60 seconds | Not distilled enough |

## Beats

Beats are narrative moves. Each beat has a **job** in the argument.

Example jobs:
- Establish stakes
- Create tension  
- Introduce the turn
- Provide proof
- Handle objection
- Land the ask

A beat is not a slide. A beat might become one slide or three. The beat defines *what it does for the argument*; slides are how it gets delivered.

### The Deletion Test

For each beat: *"If I deleted this, would the argument still work?"*

- If yes → filler. Cut it or find its real job.
- If no → structural. Keep it.

### Beat Sequence

Typical shape:
1. Stakes (why care?)
2. Tension (what's wrong? what's at risk?)
3. Turn (the insight, the solution, the reframe)
4. Proof (evidence it works)
5. Objection handling (why not X instead?)
6. Landing (the ask, the takeaway)

The **turn** should be identifiable. You should be able to point to the beat where the deck shifts from problem to solution.

## Archetypes

Slides come from constrained templates. Constraints force clarity.

| Archetype | Use | Limits |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Title | Opening, sections | Headline ≤8 words |
| Section | Divider | ≤5 words |
| Big Idea | Key insight, turn | Headline ≤12, subline ≤20 |
| Bullets | Supporting points | 3 bullets, ≤10 words each |
| Two-Column | Comparison, text+image | 2 blocks |
| Quote | Testimonial | ≤30 words + attribution |
| Chart | Data evidence | Insight headline + chart + takeaway |
| Timeline | Process | 3-5 stages |
| Comparison | Options | 2-4 cols, 3-5 rows |
| Summary | Closing | 3 items max |

### When Content Overflows

The content needs editing. The constraint doesn't need loosening.

- Headline too long → shorter words, fewer modifiers
- Too many bullets → combine or split slides
- Chart too complex → simplify data or different viz

## Critic Checks

Run these continuously, not as a discrete phase.

### Narrative Checks

- [ ] Does slide 1 open a question the final slide answers?
- [ ] Can you point to the turn slide?
- [ ] Is the hallway sentence literally on a slide?
- [ ] Any slide deletable without breaking the argument?
- [ ] Do stakes appear before the turn?

### Visual Checks

- [ ] All text within containers (no overflow)
- [ ] Constraints respected (word counts, bullet counts)
- [ ] Consistent typography
- [ ] Headlines are insights, not descriptions

### Routing Failures

When something's off, which level needs work?

| Symptom | Fix at |
|---------|--------|
| "I don't know what they want" | Spine (landing) |
| "The ending doesn't land" | Spine |
| "Slide 7 feels like filler" | Beats |
| "When does it shift?" | Spine or Beats (turn) |
| "This bullet is too long" | Content (archetype constraints) |
| "Who cares?" | Spine (stakes) |

## Working With Human Edits

When the human spikes a slide directly in Figma:

1. **See it**: Read current deck state via MCP
2. **Understand it**: What did they change? What does it imply?
3. **Adapt**: Adjust surrounding slides to match. Ask if the change suggests a spine/beat shift.

Human edits are signal. They often express what the human couldn't articulate in words.

---

## Partial Locking

Different slides are at different stages of done-ness. That's normal.

- **Locked**: Content is settled. Don't regenerate.
- **Draft**: In progress. Open to revision.
- **Stub**: Placeholder. Needs work.

Track status. Respect locks. Focus energy on what's still in flux.

## Key Principles

**The render is the thinking medium.**
You can't evaluate a deck by looking at outlines. You need to see it. Render early, render often.

**Constraints are features.**
Word limits force clarity. Archetype limits force focus. Fight the urge to "just add one more bullet."

**Filler is cancer.**
Every slide must have a job. "Provides context" is not a job unless you can say *what* context and *why* they need it before proceeding.

**The hallway sentence is the test.**
If you can't say what the deck is about in one concrete sentence, it's not done.

**Looping back is progress.**
Discovering at slide 8 that your spine is weak means the process worked. You found it before you presented.
